**Description**: A collection of my early Python scripts and exercises while learning the basics of programming. These examples cover fundamental concepts like variables, loops, functions, and more.  

## Key Topics  
- Basic syntax (print, variables, operators).  
- Control structures (if-else, loops).  
- Functions and modular code.  
- Simple data structures (lists, dictionaries).  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git

2. Navigate to any script and run it with Python:
    python script_name.py

3. Have fun!!!!
